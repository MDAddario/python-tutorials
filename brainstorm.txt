===== python-tutorials brainstorm =====

===== The main idea =====

Scrape the PEP-8 pages to properly see all python conventions and make sure you're teaching all the important topics

Go through my old python projects to make sure I'm not missing anything important

=========================

===== How to make this work =====

Have an organized LaTeX file that has all of the topics covered in each module and subsection

=================================

- Branch naming convetion

	- master: 				clean version, no answers filled in, is duplicated when creating new branches for people to fill out
	- "Vanier_2020_02_31": 	community version for a group, answers are filled in as they go, multiple of these branches can exist, keeps track of who has been taugh the tutorial
	- answers: 				has answers for all of the exercises and projects

- Module convention

	- The root directory of the repository with be composed of the README, gitignore, and multiple module_X, exercise_X, and project_X folders. These folders will contain, respectively, the tutorials, personal exercises, and group projects.
	- exercise_X: 	These will be personal-oriented exercises designed as Jupyter notebooks. 
	- project_X:	These will be group-oriented projects designed to be completed in proper python scripts and meshed together using git

- Module content

	- Each module will have multiple subfolders corresponding to the various topics to be covered

	- module_0:	installation and basics

		- How to install anaconda
		- How to use Spyder
		- How to use Jupyter
		- Difference between a compiled vs. an interpreted language
			- Motivate jupyter notebooks

			- tqdm library
		- type()
		- format strings
		- functions
			- multiple retunr values
			- default arguments

	- module_2: numpy

		- Introduction to the array
			- Comparisons bewteen operations on a list and on an array
		- Bonus scipy feature for curve_fit()

	- module_3: matplotlib

		- Basic plotting
			- plt.plot() and plt.scatter()

	GENERATORS
	if __name__ == '__main__':
	
	- module_X: Additional libraries (X > 5)
	
		- As I get better with python, document the libraries that I find useful and create tutorial modules for them
		- Maybe even plug my own libraries lmao
